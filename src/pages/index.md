  title: What is CrumpSpace?
  description: >-
    The name CrumpSpace started as a small in-joke but morphed into the overall
    idea of having a virtual or physical place where I could build, tinker,
    hack, and learn. I want to share my experiments with people—the successes
    and the failures—to hopefully inspire and teach Makers anywhere in the
    world.
